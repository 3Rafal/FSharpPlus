Alternative
===========

Applicative Functors which also have a monoid structure.

Minimal complete definition
---------------------------

 * ``return x``/``result x`` 
 * ``(<*>) f x``
 * ``empty``
 * ``append x y``/``(<|>) x y``

*)
(**
    static member Return (x:'T) : 'Alternative<'T>
    static member (<*>) (f:'T->'U, x:Alternative<'T>) : Alternative<'U>
    static member get_Empty () :'Alternative
    static member Append (x:'Alternative, y:'Alternative) :'Alternative
*)
(**

Note: ``return`` can't be used outside computation expressions, use ``result`` instead.

Other operations
----------------

 * ``mfilter``
*)
(**
    static member MFilter (x:seq<'Alternative>) :'Alternative
*)
(**


 * ``choice``
*)

Rules
-----
*)
(**
    empty <|> x = x
    x <|> empty = x
    (x <|> y) <|> z = x <|> (y <|> z)
    f <!> (x <|> y) = (f <!> x) <|> (f <!> y)
    (f <|> g) <*> x = (f <*> x) <|> (g <*> x)
    empty <*> f = empty

#r "../../bin/FSharpPlus/net45/FSharpPlus.dll"

open FSharpPlus

// this gives [2; 3; 4; 5]
let x = [2;3] <|> [] <|> [4;5]

// but I could have written
let y = [2;3] <|> empty <|> [4;5]

// choice sample usage
let alternatives = [None; Some "Result is OK"; None ; Some "Result is still OK"]
let firstGood = choice alternatives //Some "Result is OK"

// it did something like
let fstGood = None <|> Some "Result is OK" <|>  None <|> Some "Result is still OK"

// mfilter usage
let fstMatch = mfilter ((=) 5) [1;2;3;4]    // [] -> no element found, it uses the mzero value
